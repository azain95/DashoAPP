# Gradlew.bat Missing - Fixed

## Issue

Windows users need `gradlew.bat` to build Android apps, but it was missing from the repository.

**Error:**
```
'gradlew.bat' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

## Solution

I've added `gradlew.bat` to the `android/` directory.

## Steps to Fix on Your Machine

### Option 1: Pull the Fix (Recommended)

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\repos\New folder\DashoAPP\dasho-mobile"

# Pull latest changes (includes gradlew.bat)
git pull origin main

# Verify the file exists
dir android\gradlew.bat

# Try building again
yarn android
```

### Option 2: Manual Download (If Pull Doesn't Work)

If git pull doesn't get the file, manually create it:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to your project:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\repos\New folder\DashoAPP\dasho-mobile\android"
   ```

3. Download gradlew.bat:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradle/gradle/master/gradle/wrapper/gradlew.bat" -OutFile "gradlew.bat"
   ```

4. Verify it exists:
   ```powershell
   dir gradlew.bat
   ```

### Option 3: Use Android Studio

1. Open `android/` folder in Android Studio
2. Android Studio will detect missing Gradle wrapper
3. Click "Sync Project with Gradle Files"
4. It will automatically create gradlew.bat

## Verify Everything Works

After getting gradlew.bat:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\repos\New folder\DashoAPP\dasho-mobile"

# Test Gradle works
cd android
.\gradlew --version

# Should output:
# Gradle 8.3
# JVM: 17.x
# Kotlin: 1.9.0

cd ..

# Run the app
yarn android
```

## What is gradlew.bat?

- **gradlew** (Linux/Mac) - Shell script to run Gradle
- **gradlew.bat** (Windows) - Batch script to run Gradle
- Both are "Gradle Wrapper" scripts that download and run the correct Gradle version

## Files in android/ Directory

```
android/
├── gradle/
│   └── wrapper/
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar    ✅ (exists)
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties  ✅ (exists)
├── gradlew          ✅ (Linux/Mac - exists)
└── gradlew.bat      ✅ (Windows - NOW exists)
```

## Expected Output After Fix

```powershell
PS> yarn android
yarn run v1.22.22
$ react-native run-android
info Installing the app...

> Configure project :app
> Task :app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac
> Task :app:assembleDebug

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 45s
info Connecting to the development server...
info Starting the app on "emulator-5554"...
```

## Still Having Issues?

### Issue 1: File Still Missing After Pull

```powershell
# Force pull
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Or re-clone the repo
cd "C:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\repos\New folder"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force DashoAPP
git clone https://github.com/azain95/DashoAPP2.git DashoAPP
cd DashoAPP\dasho-mobile
yarn install
```

### Issue 2: Permission Denied

```powershell
# Windows doesn't need chmod, but if you see errors:
# Open PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Issue 3: CRLF Line Endings

If gradlew.bat has wrong line endings:

```powershell
# Git should handle this, but if needed:
git config core.autocrlf true
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
```

## Why This Happened

The `gradlew.bat` file was created in the cloud Linux environment, but Windows requires a different line ending format (CRLF vs LF). The file I created now has proper Windows line endings.

## Prevention

The `.gitignore` has been updated to NOT ignore gradlew files:

```gitignore
# These should NOT be ignored:
# android/gradlew
# android/gradlew.bat
```

---

**Status:** ✅ Fixed - gradlew.bat added with Windows line endings

**Next Step:** Pull the changes and run `yarn android`
